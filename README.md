Get access to the global WordPress object methods available in wp-admin.

When working with Javascript to something specific for admin pages, you may need to use `wp` object methods that are built-in in WordPress Core. Use this library to get hints for autocomplete in your IDE. If the `wp` object is not available, a friendly error will be displayed in dev console.
